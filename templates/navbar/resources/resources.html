                            In July 2023 AIM began operating in its new location on the Caltech

                            For fully funded participants AIM arranges hotel lodging and pays
                            the hotel directly. AIM also provides a per diem meal allowance and
                            a travel allowance for airfare and ground transportation from
                            participantsâ€™ home institutions. Because funding comes from the
                            National Science Foundation, there are travel requirements that must
                            be met in order to qualify for the travel allowance. Participants
                            must use the most cost-effective means of travel, which means
                            economy class tickets for air travel. Guidelines do not allow
                            reimbursement for insurance, priority boarding, seat selection,
                            economy plus, business class, or first class tickets.

                            If your travel plans are unusual for some reason (you are not
                            traveling to and from your home institution, you require an open-jaw
                            or open-return ticket, etc.) or if your travel expenses will exceed
                            the guidelines below, please document the expenses and send the
                            information to Harpreet Kaur (kaur@aimath.org) for approval before
                            completing the purchase. If your expenses are significantly higher
                            than these guidelines and you have not received approval in advance,
                            AIM may not be able to reimburse the full cost of your trip. Our FAQ
                            for AIM Participants has some additional information.

                            Airfare: The closest airports to Pasadena are Burbank Airport (BUR)
                            and Los Angeles International (LAX). BUR is much closer and ground
                            transportation is much easier, but there are fewer flights and
                            destinations available compared to LAX. Other airports in the area
                            are Long Beach (LGB), Ontario (ONT), and John Wayne (SNA). If you
                            find a cheaper airfare to one of those airports, be sure to estimate
                            the higher ground transportation costs before finalizing your
                            booking.
