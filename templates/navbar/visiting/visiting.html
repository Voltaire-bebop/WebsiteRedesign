                                   In July 2023 AIM began operating in its new location on the Caltech
                                   campus in Pasadena, CA.

                                   For fully funded participants AIM arranges hotel lodging and pays
                                   the hotel directly. AIM also provides a per diem meal allowance and
                                   a travel allowance for airfare and ground transportation from
                                   participants’ home institutions. Because funding comes from the
                                   National Science Foundation, there are travel requirements that must
                                   be met in order to qualify for the travel allowance. Participants
                                   must use the most cost-effective means of travel, which means
                                   economy class tickets for air travel. Guidelines do not allow
                                   reimbursement for insurance, priority boarding, seat selection,
                                   economy plus, business class, or first class tickets.

                                   If your travel plans are unusual for some reason (you are not
                                   traveling to and from your home institution, you require an open-jaw
                                   or open-return ticket, etc.) or if your travel expenses will exceed
                                   the guidelines below, please document the expenses and send the
                                   information to Harpreet Kaur (kaur@aimath.org) for approval before
                                   completing the purchase. If your expenses are significantly higher
                                   than these guidelines and you have not received approval in advance,
                                   AIM may not be able to reimburse the full cost of your trip. Our FAQ

                                   Airfare: The closest airports to Pasadena are Burbank Airport (BUR)
                                   and Los Angeles International (LAX). BUR is much closer and ground
                                   transportation is much easier, but there are fewer flights and
                                   destinations available compared to LAX. Other airports in the area
                                   are Long Beach (LGB), Ontario (ONT), and John Wayne (SNA). If you
                                   find a cheaper airfare to one of those airports, be sure to estimate
                                   the higher ground transportation costs before finalizing your
                                   booking.

                                   Please purchase economy class tickets for air travel at least 30
                                   days in advance. AIM cannot reimburse the cost of travel insurance,
                                   priority boarding, seat selection, economy plus, business class, or
